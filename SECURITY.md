# Security Policy
Thank you for wanting to make Quoter more secure.

Here are some guidelines of what to do:
1. Email [its.just.autumn793@gmail.com](mailto:its.just.autumn793@gmail.com)
2. Set the subject to `Quoter Security Advisory` or something of the sort
3. Describe the issue in detail, such as file names, line numbers and what the issue actually is.
4. Be ready for follow up emails as I might ask for further information

Thank you for your reports!
